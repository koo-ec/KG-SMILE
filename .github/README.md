# GraphRAG Explainability: Enhancing Transparency in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)


<img src="https://github.com/koo-ec/XGRAG/blob/main/docs/Figures/Explainability.png" alt="example">


## üìå Overview

This repository presents an approach to improving the explainability of **GraphRAG**‚Äîa framework that integrates **Knowledge Graphs (KGs)** with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to enhance AI-driven decision-making, particularly in high-stakes domains like **law** and **cybersecurity**.

The primary goal of this research is to assess how **perturbations** in knowledge graphs influence AI-generated responses and to quantify their impact using advanced **explainability metrics** such as **cosine similarity** and **inverse Wasserstein distance (inv\_WD)**.

## üîç Features

- **Graph-Based Retrieval:** Enhancing RAG with structured knowledge graphs.
- **Explainability Metrics:** Using **cosine similarity**, **Wasserstein distance**, **inverse Wasserstein distance (inv\_WD)**, and **hybrid metrics** to measure response fidelity.
- **Perturbation-Based Analysis:** Identifying influential nodes and edges in KGs by systematically altering graph structures.
- **Regression Modeling:** **Weighted linear regression** and **Bayesian Ridge Regression (BayLIME)** to evaluate graph components' significance.
- **Pre-Prompt Mechanism:** Reducing hallucinations, improving query responses through **rephrasing techniques**, and ensuring the system provides accurate answers even when direct retrieval fails.
- **Accuracy, Stability & Consistency Analysis:** Evaluating how minor modifications to the KG affect AI-generated explanations, ensuring that small changes do not significantly alter outputs while maintaining correctness and reliability in responses.
- **Graph Visualization:** Color-coded visualization to highlight impactful nodes and relationships.

## üíÇ Data Extraction & Knowledge Graph Construction

**Constructing a knowledge graph** enhances RAG performance by structuring high-quality data. Knowledge graphs store structured, semi-structured, and unstructured information, mapping out **complex relationships** between entities to support improved AI decision-making.

### **Knowledge Graph Construction Process**

- **Data Source:** Structured cybersecurity-related knowledge was extracted from **DBpedia**.
- **Querying Mechanism:** Used **SPARQL**, a query language designed for retrieving and manipulating RDF (Resource Description Framework) data.
- **Implementation:**
  - Used `SPARQLWrapper` in Python to execute queries on DBpedia‚Äôs **public SPARQL endpoint**.
  - Focused on **software-related cybersecurity** concepts containing keywords like "cyber," "security," or "malware."
  - Extracted three key attributes per entity:
    1. **Entity Label** (human-readable name)
    2. **Abstract** (descriptive summary)
    3. **Classification** (software type)
  - Filtered for **English-language abstracts and labels**.
  - Structured extracted data into **subject-predicate-object** format.
- **Relations in the Knowledge Graph:**
  - **Type relation** linking each entity to the **Software** category.
  - **Label relation** providing a meaningful name.
  - **Abstract relation** storing textual descriptions.

This structured **KG** supports **downstream tasks**, including:

- **Question Answering**
- **Semantic Reasoning**
- **Explainability Analysis in Cybersecurity Applications**

The resulting **knowledge graph** serves as a **foundational dataset** for evaluating **stability** and **fidelity** in graph-based representations, which is **central to this research**.

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

### **Fidelity Metrics**

- **Cosine Similarity:** Measures how similar the original and perturbed responses are by comparing vector representations.
- **Wasserstein Distance (WD):** Captures **distributional shifts** between original and perturbed outputs.
- **Inverse Wasserstein Distance (inv\_WD):** Highlights **opposite nodes** and emphasizes contrasting elements, improving interpretability.
- **Hybrid Metric (Cosine - WD - inv\_WD):** Balances **local alignment**, **global structure changes**, and **contrastive interpretability**.

### **Accuracy Metrics**

- **Ground Truth Comparison:** Evaluates AI-generated responses against **human-verified correct answers**.
- **Precision & Recall:** Measures correctness and retrieval efficiency.
- **F1 Score:** Provides a balanced accuracy assessment.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Quantifies the average deviation from expected results.

### **Stability Analysis**

- **Jaccard Similarity Index:** Evaluates response consistency under minor KG perturbations.
- **Temperature Control (T=0 vs. T=1):** Analyzes **deterministic vs. stochastic retrieval** effects.

### **Consistency Metrics**

- **Box Plot Analysis:** Measures response variation across different KG segments.
- **Statistical Regression Models:** **Bayesian Ridge** and **Weighted Linear Regression** for explanation uniformity.

### **Explainability Through Perturbation**

- **Graph Component Analysis:** Identifies nodes/edges influencing AI-generated responses.
- **Visualization:** **Color-coded KG representation** highlighting influential components.

### **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning**

- **Multi-Step Logical Deductions:** Ensures structured, explainable decision-making by breaking down queries into intermediate steps.
- **Interpretability Enhancement:** Reduces AI hallucinations and improves response coherence in high-stakes domains.

### **Pre-Prompting for Query Refinement**

- **Rephrased Queries:** Enhances retrieval accuracy by generating multiple query variants.
- **Filtering Mechanism:** Eliminates uncertain responses ("I don‚Äôt know").
- **Embedding-Based Aggregation:** Synthesizes multiple responses for improved robustness.
